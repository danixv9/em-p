- A comprehensive medtriage.ai open source startup with the goal of enhancing ER thorough put for our overburdened ER services. This app will forever be open source and a testament to how an open source medical AI app can revolutionize one of muliple parts of health care -the ED!

- Think of the UI/UX as YOU dressing a wound, tending stiches, stopping bleeds in the ER

- With this open source, we will basically transform the shape of the ED worldwide!
- I welcome ideas on how to ensure that this remains 100% OPEN SOURCE, not OPENAI opensource!
